# BrickBreaker

A simple, old-fashioned Brickbreaker game which I have built in C++/OpenGL. The player controls the platform with the mouse. Mouse left-click starts the game. You only have 3 lives. Good luck!

It was done on top of a framework provided to us by our univesity. If you want to play the game, you can download the whole framework the link below. You'll need to open the Framework_EGC.sln (Visual Studio Solution) located here Framework-EGC-master\Visual Studio\Framework_EGC.sln. Build, run, play!
